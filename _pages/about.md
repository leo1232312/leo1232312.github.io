## About Me {#about}

I am **Yihang Jiang**, an undergraduate student majoring in **Artificial Intelligence** at **South China University of Technology (SCUT)**.  
My research interests focus on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **The application of large language models**, especially **Automated Essay Scoring (AES)**. 

**Current focus:** The application of LLMS.

## <i class="far fa-file-alt"></i> Selected Publications {#publications}


- **Towards Reliable and Consistent Essay Scoring: A Collaborative Framework with Task-Adaptive Prior Injection**  
  *ACL 2026 submission (under review).*  
  **Keywords:** Automated Essay Scoring, Teacher LLM, prior injection, scale drift, score–feedback alignment. 


## <i class="fas fa-code"></i> Projects {#projects}

### 1) Reliable Scoring & Consistent Feedback Calibration (ACL 2026)

### 2) MCM/ICM 2025 (Problem C): Olympic Success Prediction & “Great Coach” Effect
- Proposed an integrated framework combining **XGBoost medal count prediction**, **Bayesian Probit Regression with MCMC**, **Fixed Effects Models**, and **Lagged Regression**.
- Performed **feature engineering** and interpretability analysis via **SHAP**, and quantified uncertainty for “first medal” probability estimation.
- Output a complete modeling–validation–report pipeline with reproducible results and actionable insights for strategy planning. 

### 3) Baidu Brain Cup (Student Innovation Competition) — Real-time Visual Tracking & Closed-loop Control
- Designed a “perception–decision–actuation” closed-loop system on **Raspberry Pi**.
- Implemented **real-time target detection/tracking** using **OpenCV**, computed target coordinates, and controlled an actuator via a **stepper motor module** to track motion trajectories.
- Integrated embedded hardware wiring, sensor interfaces, motor driving, and system debugging for an end-to-end prototype. 


## <i class="fas fa-trophy"></i> Awards {#awards}

- **MCM/ICM 2025 — Meritorious Winner (Problem C)**
- **Baidu Brain Cup Student Innovation Competition — Third Prize** 

## Skills {#skills}
